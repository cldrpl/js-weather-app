# weather-app

This is a JavaScript based weather application. My course had it setup using Weather Underground's API, and they changed how they handle giving out API keys so OpenWeatherMap was an option. I worked off of the course, troubleshooting, and other reference points on how to fetch and display the data from a different source. I also tried cleaning it up and displaying it in my own format with City and Country to try and match the original course design.

I would recommend registering and getting your own API key from OpenWeatherMap since it is fairly easy to use. Also consider how often you are calling their API since they are very wary of that on their development pages. 

Thanks!
Mike
